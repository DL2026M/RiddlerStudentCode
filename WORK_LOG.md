| Aug 21 | 10:00am - 10:45am | For #1, we found that whatever letter was written, we had to move +9 in the alphabet to the right. That's all we did during the classtime.

For #2, we figured out that each number was a direct match to an ascii value. For #3, we solved it by understanding that we needed to convert the binary to numbers to ascii values, which gave us the poem. |
| Aug 27 | 9:15pm - 11:45pm  |                                          I wrote all of the code for each decryption and managed to solve find the answer (the author for each of the 4 poems was the same). I used some of the code that was on the slides for #1 to get an idea on how to approach it (in terms of actually writing code). it took me a long time to figure out the parseint on #2 (mainly). It was really good to chat and work through these problems with my friends! |
