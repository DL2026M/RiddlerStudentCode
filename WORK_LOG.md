| Aug 24 | 9:00pm-11:30pm | Didn't right any code due to having intelliJ errors, but I found the name of the first 3 poems with Oliver. For #1, we found that whatever letter was written, we had to move +9 in the alphabet to the right. For #2, we figured out that each number was a direct match to an ascii value. For #3, we solved it by understanding that we needed to convert the binary to numbers to ascii values, which gave us the poem. |
